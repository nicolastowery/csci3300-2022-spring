unlike Java, JS will accet other values besides true and false as true and false. This is true with C++ as well
    String: "" == false;
            anything else == true;
    Num: 0 == false;
        anything else == true;

IEEE 764
to find if numbers are equal to eachother |a-b| < .0001
.0001 is the threshold
absolute value in JS is Math.abs(a-b)
