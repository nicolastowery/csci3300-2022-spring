 The memory in JS is managed for you, unless if you are doing something super complex, you'll never think about this

VARIABLES
 Only characters you can use for variable names
    letters
    numbers
    underscore
    dollar sign

All language letters are supported, but it is advised you only use English

Variables cannot be named keywords that do something
    example: function

Can't start a name with a nunmber
Can't use a math op in a name
Can't use punctuation in a name
Can't use a space in a name

Names are case sensitive

camelCase is the notation used for cariable names

Variables don't have int or String in front of them. You just say let x = 4; or let y = "hello";
